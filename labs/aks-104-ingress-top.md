# Module AKS104:  Ingress Controllers

An ingress controller is a piece of software that provides reverse proxy, configurable traffic routing, and TLS termination for Kubernetes services. Kubernetes ingress resources are used to configure the ingress rules and routes for individual Kubernetes services. Using an ingress controller and ingress rules, a single IP address can be used to route traffic to multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster. In this lab, you have 3 different types of ingress controller - `HTTP Application Routing`, `NGINX Ingress Controller`, and `Application Gateway Ingress Controller`. Please try one of them.
